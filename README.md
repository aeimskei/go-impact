# Social Impact Experience

Creating a more meaningful traveling experience and bringing awareness to social enterprises.

A social enterprise is a hybrid of a non-profit/NGO and private. A self-sustaining business model thatâ€™s mission driven.

Ex.) Delancy St Restaurant in SF, gives a second chance to previous inmates, trains them the skills in food industry, Yangon Bakehouse in Yangon, Myanmar, give women living in poverty a chance to be trained in service industry.

Collaborated with Justin Chau, pair-programmed building end-to-end.
